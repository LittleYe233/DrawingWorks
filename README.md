# DrawingWorks

## Introduction

This is an archive for some drawing works, including potential "failures" (like works created in an early age) and some might-be-successful ones (like works after a long period of practice).

## Goals

I said that this repo contains / will contain those "successful" works - which are enough for commercial use and for me to get benefit. But I am more eager to *share* my ideas on those works - maybe you can get something useful from it and *exchange* your ideas in a discussion. This makes a huge boost for not only me, but many others.

I found some well-known illustrators sold PSD files of their works. We can't blame this kind of act, and I can and plan to do that in the future. But here I don't and won't sell them. This is an example of the spirit of open-source.

Beyond archiving, the repo has more goals: sharing, exchanging, learning.

## Usage

### `works/*.kra` files

These are project files of [Krita](https://krita.org/), "a professional FREE and open source painting program". You can use Krita to open them.

All works start from `.kra` files, for I don't use Windows now and can't use Photoshop for painting.

### Other built files

The repo may contain other built files like `*.psd` or `*.png` files. These can be generated by Krita GUI and CLI. If there aren't any, please generate them by yourself or await pre-compiled version in [Releases](https://github.com/LittleYe233/DrawingWorks/releases) and demo webpage.

### Convert to other formats

```bash
krita <input> --export --export-filename <output>
```

For instance,

```bash
krita works/part_of_neofetch_mixture.kra --export --export-filename works/part_of_neofetch_mixture.png
```

### `metadata.yml`

You can use this metadata file to host the works on a web service.
