# DrawingWorks

## Introduction

This is an archive for some drawing works, including potential "failures" (like works created in an early age) and some might-be-successful ones (like works after a long period of practice).

## Goals

I said that this repo contains / will contain those "successful" works - which are enough for commercial use and for me to get benefit. But I am more eager to *share* my ideas on those works - maybe you can get something useful from it and *exchange* your ideas in a discussion. This makes a huge boost for not only me, but many others.

I found some well-known illustrators sold PSD files of their works. We can't blame this kind of act, and I can and plan to do that in the future. But here I don't and won't sell them. This is an example of the spirit of open-source.

Beyond archiving, the repo has more goals: sharing, exchanging, learning.
